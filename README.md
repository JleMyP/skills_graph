# skills-graph
  Demanded skills visualization as a graph\
  Backend: tags scraper and parcer\
  Frontend: graph dynamic visualization 

#
### TODO
##### Backend:
* change raw format from pickle (list) to json as \
{'phrase': '', 'vacancies_number': int, items: list}
* preprocess: turn off filtering - return all nodes and links
* how to split job modules?

##### Frontend:
* add buttons with phrase name, parced vacancies number
* mark connected nodes if pushing on one of the nodes

renew JSON interface:\
add phrase and vacancies_number

##### Ideas
* monetization: ads? offers? contacts?
* private domain? + hosting?
